So, lets take an example if we are working on some branch and want to switch to some another branch but git wont let me without commit so here git stash comes in, so we stash that changes we have made on that branch to use it latter in another branch, and in stash we can stash multiple changes over and over and it saves it in order. So now for accessing that stashed changes we use git stash apply or git stash pop, so the difference between apply and pop, in apply we can access that stashed changes multiple times and in pop it can accessed only once.
